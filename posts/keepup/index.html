<p>This was written with C and Emscripten, and represents my first steps in getting a game to run in browser. 
After this project, I began to learn and work with Rust instead of C. </p>
<p>Due to not wanting to deal with Emscripten again, I've elected to simply send you to the old web player. Have fun, my high score is 140!</p>
