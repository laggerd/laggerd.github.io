    <p>This is what a big old paragraph looks like when you write it out with your hand on a keyboard on a dell laptop in one big runon sentence with losts of spices like rosmary and thyme with a bit of lime juice becuase limes are so much better than lemons. I wonder if anyone has ever considered solving the problem of limes lacking the same amount of joice as lemons though. The last few limes I've bought have not had enough juice to satisfy my needs, and I had to use a hand vice to squeeze a barely acceptable amount from the lime. However, I believe it was worth it, that artichoke tasted and smelled great, and would probably not have had I followed the propgandizing recipie from the online lemon shills.    -laggerd</p>
